# `ant`
`ant` is yet another text editor, written in Rust and C. It aims to be small, fast, and efficient, while maintaining important features.

## Why Another Text Editor?
This is mainly a learning project, but there are some good reasons to use `ant`:

- Much of it is written in Rust, ensuring memory, type, and thread safety while using the program.

- Features a load of configuration options that can make it as powerful as vim, or as simplistic as nano.

- Ant can also serve as an introduction to modal editors in the terminal.

- Editing a typical file in Ant can use less than 1 \*megabyte of ram.

\*This value can vary depending on the file.
